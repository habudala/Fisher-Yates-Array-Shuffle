### Applying the Fisher-Yates Shuffling Method to JavaScript Arrays

#### - I have created an array of ordered numbers spannig from 1-15
#### - With the use of a for loop, I reconstructed the shuffle method developed by Fisher & Yates
#### - I repeat the shuffle method 7 times using another (outer) for loop
#### - I've also decided to create a new custom method for the Array object, and added the shuffle sequence using 
####   the "prototype" keyword (it's something I decided to do later, so I commented out my original code)
